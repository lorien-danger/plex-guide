requested content:

Your request will initially show a blue "Requested" tag, indicating it's been
submitted and is being processed.

#### Step 3: Wait for Content to Be Available

After processing (which usually takes around 5-10 minutes), the status will
change to "Available":

**Note:** If you allowed notifications when first using the app, you'll receive
a notification when your request becomes available for watching.

#### Step 4: Watch Your Content on Plex

Once your request shows as "Available", you can open Plex to enjoy your content:

The requested movie or show will appear in the "Recently Added" section in Plex,
ready for you to watch.

## Managing Your Requests

You can view all your current and past requests by clicking on "Requests" in the
navigation menu of Jellyseerr. From there, you can:

- See which requests are pending
- Check which content is already available
- Cancel requests if needed

## Tips for Using Jellyseerr

- **Browse Popular Content**: The home page shows trending and popular movies
  and TV shows
- **Check Release Dates**: For new movies, check when they'll be available for
  home release
- **Request Full Seasons**: For TV shows, you can request entire seasons,
  although please only request the season you intend to watch as requesting the

  show you want
